## Documentation: Animate99 Animation library

### What is Animate99?
Animate99 is a JavaScript animation library built for beginner developers. It allows you to easily incorporate animations into your programs without the hassle of writing the code from scratch.
Built into the library is a collection of functions written using normal language (for ease of use) and defined to produce specific animation effects. The developer is also provided with substantial flexibility in how they choose to apply the animations to their code.

### JavaScript vs CSS animations, what’s the difference?
Scripted animations provide greater control and flexibility compared to CSS animations. Animating with CSS  may seem like the easiest way to get something moving on your screen but you will need JavaScript when you need significant control over your animations, because JavaScript doesn’t just provide you with animation functionality, it allows you to easily customize exactly just how you want these animations to behave in your program.  The selling point of the Animate99 library is that it does the heavy lifting of creating customizable and flexible animation functions, all you have to do is sit back and call on them.
